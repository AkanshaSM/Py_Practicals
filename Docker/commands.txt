docker init 
docker compose up –build 
docker images 

 
Step 7: Login to docker using docker login 
 
docker tag image_name DOCKER_HUB_NAME/image_name to tag the image which is a custom, human-readable manifest identifier that is typically a specific version or variant of an image. 
docker push DOCKER_HUB_NAME/image_name to share your images to the Docker Hub registry or to a self-hosted one.  
docker pull DOCKER_HUB_NAME/image_name to pull your images from the Docker Hub registry to the local repository.
 




B) Develop docker image for python script and store it on docker registry
Use the docker build -t image_name command – used to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile
Use docker images command - used to list all the Docker images that are currently stored on the local system.
Use docker run -d -p 5000:5000 image_name command - used to run a Docker container in detached mode (-d) and map a port from the host to a port in the container (-p).
-d runs the container in the background, freeing up the terminal for other commands.
-p specifies the port mapping, with the format <host_port>:<container_port>---it maps port 5000 from the host to port 5000 in the container.
